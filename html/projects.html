                <p> <strong>Queto</strong> will be an <strong>intelligent</strong> autonomous system agents designed to
                    <strong>detect, analyze, respond to and learn from crisis situations.</strong>
                    Based on events of different natures (such as system failures, cyberattacks, or anomalous sound events),
                    the agent executes response, planning, learning, and reporting protocols based on LLMs (LLaMA 3.2).</p>

                <p> The application works on mobile devices (Android and IOS), has a loading screen, 
                    a home screen with the user's data and their assets on the date they enter. 
                    If you do not yet have an account in the application, it will be necessary to register, 
                    in the registration you will be asked for data such as: Name, email and password, once registered, 
                    the user will be redirected to the login screen again, entering the application with their email and password. 
                    Within the application, he sees on the presentation screen a welcome message and the data of the creators of the application, 
                    and some options of pages that he can enter. There is also a menu at the bottom of the screen that has options such as: 
                    profile, add and view the assets, which is divided by categories. The application does not retain sensitive data, such as: 
                    CPF, Identity, Renavam, branch and bank account number. The calculations made in relation to equity are based on information 
                    obtained from reliable accounting sources.</p>

                <p> The objective of this work is to create a <strong>webchat</strong> that has <strong>accessibility</strong> tools,
                    like listening to the text and saying what you want to send to someone else. This is a <strong> real-time</strong> webchat.</p>

                <p> <strong>Assist in the control and monitoring</strong> of the flow of use of computers by students in the laboratories, 
                    <strong>identifying</strong> who enters and leaves them and the times when these events occurred. 
                    In this way, aiming at an improvement in the <strong>safety</strong>of laboratory machines. The system mainly affects the 
                    monitors and students, in addition to the IT manager, but, in general, it will affect UFC as a whole. 
                    <strong>The system impacts the way of controlling and monitoring the flow of students who attend the computers of UFC 
                        laboratories for various purposes.</strong></p>

                <p> This is a <strong>digital clock</strong> made of arduino, the stopwatch serves as a counter that when it reaches 
                    a certain time the alarm beeps.</p>

                <p> FreeRTOS is an open source kernel simulator, used for real-time applications.
                    This project simulates the creation of 4 tasks, which are equivalent to threads.
                    The function that executes task 3 is used to suspend the execution of task 3.
                    The vTaskSuspend() function is used to make this interruption, so that the tasks run in a loop again, the
                    function vTaskResume(), this is what occurs inside the for loop of task 2, in this function there is an i counter,
                    The counter starts at 0, and increments each time Task 2 is executed by the kernel.
                    When the counter i reaches 2, task 3 is re-harvested once again.
                    When the counter i receives 6 as a variable value, task 4 will be executed, which terminates the kernel.</p>
